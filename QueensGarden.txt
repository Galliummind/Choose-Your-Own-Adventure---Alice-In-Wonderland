Leaving that rabbit behind Alice walked a distance until she saw a large rose-tree standing near the entrance of a garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like that!'Five flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low. Before Alice could speak to them they all turned and continued painting the roses red. 'Which way to the palace?' Alice Asked, Each gardener pointed to a sign 'King's Jungle.'  Five leaned over to Alice, "Dont touch the yellow flowers! They're the queens favorites."
