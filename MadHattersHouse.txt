Walking through a clearing Alice see a house without windows or doors. The more She look at the house the less it makes sense "I hope the owner was expecting guests, and not a carpenter" she said aloud. Alice  entered the house, a man sitting at a table looks up from his glass and frowns in your direction, his eyebrows furl and his eyes grow darker beneath his hat. He walks towards you with a menacing look!
