Alice walked what seemed like forever always keeping her bearing North! "I don't remember ever north ever being so long" Alice muttered to herself. Suddenely Alice couldn't walk north any longer, a solid wall the span of ten men, plus two stood in her way. Alice looked to her left...then her right. "It seems I have reached a dead end." She said to no one.
