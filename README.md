#### Choose-Your-Own-Adventure---Alice-In-Wonderland Project
This will be my first public github repository and project submission, so any feedback would be appreciated on how I could improve.
This project was started in 2020 as a project required for my computer science studies. I thouroughly enjoyed the project, but it was 
a test of my skills for sure. I spent a lot of time stuck and some embarassing moments where a simple syntax error threw off my entire project. 

Simply compile and run the java file "AliceInWonderland.java" and hopefully you will enjoy.
