Alice looked at the door. Holding the key that was still in the door's keyhole she turned it "Are you telling me the truth? If I find this Queen's Crown you will send me home?"
 
The door gave another yelp. "OOOW! Of course I am, why would I lie! Please please let go of me."
 
Alice loosened her grip on the door "Okay, I will get the Crown so I can go home."
