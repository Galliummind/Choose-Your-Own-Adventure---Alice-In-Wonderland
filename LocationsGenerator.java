 * Class LocationsGenerator:

 * and deposit them into an ArrayList. The LocationsGenerator will 
 * manipulate those objects with their own get/set methods and some custom
 * remove objects methods.

 * Compiling and running instructions
 * Assuming JDK 11.0.7 (or later) and the CLASSPATH are set up properly.
 * Change to the directory containing the source code.
 * Compile:    javac LocationsGenerator.java
 * Run:        java LocationsGenerator

/** Test Plan
 * 1 . Run the application. 
 * EXPECTED:
 * The main method will run an Instance of AliceInWonderLand. Then Alice will
 * move to multiple locations, This will demonstrate the Custom and default constructor can 
 * be reliable called. This will also demonstrate the follwing method:
	public LocationsGenerator()
	public LocationsGenerator(String TextFileNameHere)
	public void locationsWhereAreyou()
	public String bringConnectedPlacesForward(int currentLocation)
	public StringBuffer textFileReaderLocation(int currentLocation)
	public  void getLocation(int currentLocation)
	public void textFileReader(String fileName)
 * 
 * ACTUAL:
 * Application runs as expected. Alice is capable of moving throughout the game, 
 * appropriate suggestions on where she would like to move are given. And if she has visisted the
 * location before a short description will be given.

    /**Method locationsWhereAreYou
     * This method is critical in the program.
     * When an instance of this method is run it will continously creating an infinite
     * loop that can only be broken outside of the while loops scope. For example if 
     * Alice dies or wins the game a system.exit(0); command will be passed ending the program.
     * I have sources mentioning when this would be necessary or even desired to 
     * create a while loop that doesn't end. 
     * https://www.baeldung.com/infinite-loops-java
     * 
     * In this infinite while loop, a new instance of class Locations Generator
     * is created (LG). An instance of the method LG.getLocation is initiaded
     * and the parameter int currentLocation is passed to the method. CurrentLocation
     * is a variable of object LG and LG is an instance of class LocationsGenerator.
     * The method getLocation will print a short description or a long description
     * depending on if the parameter being passed to the method has been used before.
     * for more details of getLocation() please go to the method.
     * 
     * Next an object newControls is made. newControls is an instance of class
     * Controls. List of Controls is invoked and the parameters of currentLocations is
     * passed. The reason for passing the currentLocation to this method is it will
     * influence the available options. For example in the method listOfControls(currentLocation)
     * the user can decide to move() to another location. The program will need
     * the currentLocation variable to determine which paths to load, which discussion to load,
     * etc. Essentially the variable currentLocation is used to determine a lot of 
     * what the program does. That is why the variable is public and that is why
     * currentLocation = newControls.listOfControls(currentLocation); because the variable
     * currentLocation will be influenced by other methods. 
     * 
     * Because this is an infinite loop (ie the value of currentLocation will never
     * be 100) This loop essentialy runs the entire game!
